It was a little behind us, and the creaking of the wicker-work made us look round quicklyâ€”just in time to see, to our amazement, a small round female spring out of the chair and run nimbly through a long glass door into the drawing-room, followed by a waddling, wheezing ball of yellow fur which had been lurking with her in the recesses of the sentry-box.</p></div> </div>
